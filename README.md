# ![](frontend/public/flavicon.svg) RhizoBook | Health Appointment Scheduler

A full-stack healthcare appointment scheduling system built with NestJS, Next.js, and TypeScript. Patients can browse providers, book appointments, and manage their schedule. Providers can view upcoming appointments and manage cancellations.

## 🚧 Status

- **Backend API** — Live at **https://rhizo-book-production.up.railway.app/api** (Swagger UI)
- **Frontend** — deployed and functional
- Both services connect to a hosted PostgreSQL database on [Neon](https://neon.tech)
